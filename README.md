# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the application of engineering principles to develop, test and maintain software efficiently and reliably.
IMPORTANCE
Ensures high-quality, reliable software
Supports scalability and future updates
Enhances collaboration in teams
Increases development efficiency


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The birth of software engineering -1968_ was introduced at the NATO conference to address software crises
Introduction of object oriented programming - 1980_improved code reusability and maintainability
Agile development -2000s_focused on iterative development and team collaboration



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning - define project goals,scope and feasibility
2.Requirements Analysis - Gather and document user and system requirements
3.Design - create software architecture, UI/UX and database design
4.Implementation - Write the actual program code
5.Testing - Identify and fix bugs through different testing methods
6.Deployment - Release the software for users 
7.Maintenance - Provide updates,bug fixes and improvements



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In terms of approach, waterfall methodology uses sequential while agile methodology uses iterative
In terms of flexibility, waterfall methodology uses rigid while agile methodology uses adaptive
In terms of changes, waterfall methodology is hard to implement while agile methodology is easy to adjust
Waterfall methodology is used in Banking systems (projects with fixed requirements) while Agile methodology is used in Mobile apps with frequent updates (projects needing flexibility)

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - Designs, writes and maintains software code
Quality assurance engineer - Tests the software, finds bugs and ensures quality
Project manager - plans, organizes and oversees the project to ensure timely delivery


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs - Visual Studio Code
provide tools for coding, debugging and testing
VCS- Git
Tracks code changes and facilitates collaboration

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Security issues - Implement secure coding practices 
Keeping up with Technology - Continous learning and training 
Debugging complex code - use structured debugging techniques

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - Tests individual components
Intergration testing - Ensures all components work together
System testing - Tests the entire application
Acceptance testing - Confirms software meets user requirements


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input prompts to get accurate and relevant responses from AI models
IMPORTANCE
Enhances AI response quality
Improves efficiency in obtaining useful answers
Reduces errors and misunderstandings
Helps tailor AI interactions for specific use cases

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: tell me about planets
Improved prompt: explain the characteristics of the planets in our solar system focusing on their size and distance from the sun
                : It gives clear instructions on what information is needed and narrows the focus to relevant details
